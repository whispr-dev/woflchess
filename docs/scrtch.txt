Add special move handling (castling, en passant)
a method to print the board so we can verify the setup? We could also add some unit tests to make sure everything is positioned correctly.

highlighting possible moves or the last move made

Basic move validation for each piece type
The move input system (like "e2 to e4")

Check/checkmate detection to prevent invalid moves that leave the king in check



More descriptive error messages (e.g., "Invalid move: Bishop cannot jump over pieces" instead of just "Invalid move")
Support for traditional algebraic notation (like "Nf3" for knight to f3)
Move suggestions when an invalid move is entered
Ability to show available moves for a selected piece
