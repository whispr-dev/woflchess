Fren, here are a few fun and interesting ideas you could consider adding to your chess project:

Chess Variants (e.g., Chess960 or “Fischer Random”)

Inject new life into gameplay by randomizing the back rank pieces.
This would also be a neat challenge for your neural networks, since the standard opening heuristics won’t apply.
PGN Import/Export & Move Notation

Let players save their games in the standard PGN (Portable Game Notation) format, which can then be loaded into other chess programs or studied in detail.
Conversely, let the user load in PGN to watch or analyze classical master games, right in your app.
Opening Book or Endgame Tablebases

Integrate a small built-in opening database that your engine can reference.
You could also implement or link to precomputed tablebases for simplified endgames (like King + Queen vs. King). This can teach or ensure perfect play at the end of the game.
More Advanced AI Search (e.g., alpha-beta pruning, iterative deepening, parallelization)

Even though you have the “Neural” approach, you can still augment it with tried-and-true search techniques.
Consider implementing an iterative deepening approach with alpha-beta pruning, which can drastically improve move selection speed and quality.
Time Controls & Clock Handling

Add different time controls (blitz, rapid, classical).
Show a clock that counts down for each player, pausing when it’s the opponent’s turn.
User Interface Enhancements

If you haven’t already, add a graphical board with clickable pieces and squares for an intuitive user experience.
Animations for moving pieces, highlighting last move, showing captured pieces, etc.
Puzzles & Tactics Trainer

Let users practice tactics by generating or loading puzzle positions where there’s a forced mate or a specific tactic to find.
Scoring or rating system to keep track of puzzle performance.
Analysis / Move Suggestions

After a game or during play, show recommended moves or evaluations from the engine.
Possibly highlight squares or moves that are particularly strong or weak.
Logging & Stats

Track a user’s performance over time: how many games they’ve won, lost, or drawn, average move times, average mistakes, etc.
Provide a performance rating estimate to give them a sense of skill progression.
Multiplayer or Online Mode

Expand from local-only to an online mode, so your neural engine can challenge other human opponents.
Could even provide matchmaking or ELO calculations if you store user data.
“Explain Move” or “Commentary” Feature
For each move, generate a short explanation of why the engine likes or dislikes it. It can be as simple as referencing material changes or checking some heuristics.
Even if it’s not super-sophisticated, players will appreciate the insight.
Board Customization & Themes
Let users select various piece styles, board colors, or backgrounds.
This is mostly cosmetic, but it adds a polish that players love.
