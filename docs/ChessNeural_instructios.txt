----------------------------------------------

Use play to start a game against the AI
- enter move as either e.g. `b1c3` or `b1 c3`
- castling is done via `O-O` for kingside and O-O-O queenside.
- if no piece is chosen from q/r/k/b when a pawn reaches the back rank it will default to promotion to queen.
- most everything else is auto-triggered by attempting to move to the relevant ssquare on the board with appropriate piece.

Training::

Weight persistence:

Saves neural network weights to a JSON file
Loads weights on startup
Periodically saves during training


Training commands:

train time XX - Train for XX minutes
train games XX - Train for XX number of games
Training results are displayed after completion
------------------------------------------------

To use it:

Start the program
Use train time 15 to train for 15 minutes
Use train games 100 to train for 100 games
The AI will get progressively better as it trains

The weights are saved to "neural_weights.json" and will be loaded automatically when you restart the program.
